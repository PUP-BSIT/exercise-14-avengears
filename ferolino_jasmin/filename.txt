The BSIT 3-1 and DIT 2-1 conducted F2F class rather than online class. I prefer face-to-face classes to online classes since they can give various benefits, most notably interpersonal connection and immersive learning experiences.  
One of the key advantages of face-to-face learning is human interaction. In a typical classroom, students and teachers can converse in real time. This contact increases engagement, understanding, and motivation. Face-to-face learning allows students to ask questions, clarify doubts, and get quick response from their lecturers.
Students appreciate individually sessions with teachers, constructive criticism, practical instruction, networking opportunities, and improved communication skills as well as less distractions and increased accountability. Even though learning online has benefits, it cannot overcome the advantages of classroom instruction. 
I therefore, I conclude that face-to-face learning is more important than onlin instruction.  F2F Learning can lessen interruptions. There is a lower chance of interruptions from notifications or other electronic distractions for students. Better focus and concentration as a result may enhance learning outcomes.
